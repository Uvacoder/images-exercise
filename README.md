## Running a local server

No server or build tool is required, but with some tools you may want to run a web server to host the static folder locally.

If you already have Ruby installed, run this in the root and then access at localhost:3000:

```
$ ruby -run -e httpd . -p 3000
```

If you have Node installed:

```
$ npm install http-server -g
$ http-server
```
